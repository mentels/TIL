# TIL

My personal *Today I Learned* inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til)

This a collection of small things that I learn on daily basis in the software
engineering world. This is not only a record of my journey through tech but also
a way to capture stuff that I find useful and don't want to forget. Finally, it's
about practising writing.

_8 TIL and counting..._
